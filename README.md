# SimplePokedex
[TSE FISE3 INFO6 IHM] Mobile Computing Android Development TP

## Intro

Inspired by serveral Android projects on GitHub (like [faviouz/pokedex](https://github.com/faviouz/pokedex) and [alvareztech/Pokedex](https://github.com/alvareztech/Pokedex) ), I'm very interested in creating a small and simple Android application which works like an offline Pokedex which names *SimplePokedex*. Here I list some features and requirements:

### Features

- List 1st generation Pokemons
- Detailed Pokemon characteristics

### Usability Goals

- Use the application offline
- Maintain a minimalistic design to not distract the user while playing the game

## UI
